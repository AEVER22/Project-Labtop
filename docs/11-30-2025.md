## Homelab Build & Documentation

### Overview
This repository documents the full setup, configuration, and troubleshooting journey of building a virtualized homelab environment. The goal of this project is to practice real-world cybersecurity and systems administration tasks using Windows Server 2012, Windows 10, and Kali Linux inside a controlled virtual network.
The lab includes:
- A Windows Server 2012 domain controller
- A Windows 10 workstation
- A Kali Linux attack box
- A fully isolated internal network ("Labnet")
This documentation is written to demonstrate technical ability, problem-solving, and practical IT experience for employers and future projects.

### Lab Architecture
Virtualization Platform: VirtualBox
Internal Network Name: Labnet
Purpose: Isolated test environment for Windows Server, Windows 10, and Kali Linux

## Activity Log
Below is the day-by-day timeline of building the lab, including steps taken, problems encountered, and how they were resolved.

## November 30th, 2025

### Goal
Build a realistic Active Directory environment by creating organizational units, user accounts, administrative structures and service accounts.

### Organizational Unit Structure
The initial task involved designing a clear OU structure suitable for administrative tasks and future testing. The following OUs were created:
- LABNET-Users
- LABNET-ServiceAccounts
- LABNET-Admins
- LABNET-Computers
- LABNET-Servers

### Timeline
9:23 AM — Started the virtual machines and ran ipconfig in PowerShell to confirm that all network configurations remained consistent. All settings were correct.

9:28 AM — Began creating organizational units. An initial mistake resulted in nested units being placed inside another OU unintentionally. Corrected the error by removing the misplaced entries and recreating the OUs.

9:37 AM — Successfully created all primary organizational units.

9:42 AM — Moved the Windows 10 workstation from the default Computers container to LABNET-Computers. Reviewed the system properties, including operating system information and domain membership.

9:45 AM — Added four employee accounts to the LABNET-Users OU.

9:56 AM — Created an administrator account in the LABNET-Admins OU. Assigned the account membership in the following groups:
- Domain Admins
- Domain Users
- Enterprise Admins
- Group Policy Creator Owners
- Server Operators

10:06 AM — Created departmental groups in LABNET-Users to simulate internal organizational structure. Added the appropriate users to the IT, Marketing and Finance groups.

10:13 AM — Created a service account in the LABNET-ServiceAccounts OU. This account will be used for:
- Kerberoasting demonstrations
- Constrained delegation testing
- Service misconfiguration scenarios

### Summary
The Active Directory environment now includes a structured OU design, department-based groups, standard user accounts, administrative accounts and a functional service account. This provides a realistic and extensible foundation for future security testing and configuration work.

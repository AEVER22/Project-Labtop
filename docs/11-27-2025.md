# Homelab Build & Documentation

## Overview
This repository documents the full setup, configuration, and troubleshooting journey of building a virtualized homelab environment. The goal of this project is to practice real-world cybersecurity and systems administration tasks using Windows Server 2012, Windows 10, and Kali Linux inside a controlled virtual network.

The lab includes:
- A Windows Server 2012 domain controller
- A Windows 10 workstation
- A Kali Linux attack box
- A fully isolated internal network ("Labnet")

This documentation is written to demonstrate technical ability, problem-solving, and practical IT experience for employers and future projects.

## Lab Architecture
**Virtualization Platform:** VirtualBox

**Internal Network Name:** Labnet  
**Purpose:** Isolated test environment for Windows Server, Windows 10, and Kali Linux

### Machines
| Machine | Purpose | Specs | Network |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| Windows Server 2012 | Domain Controller (lab.net) | 30GB HDD, 4GB RAM, 2 cores | Internal (Labnet), NAT |
| Windows 10 | Domain-joined workstation | 30GB HDD, 4GB RAM, 2 cores | Internal (Labnet) |
| Kali Linux | Pen-testing and monitoring | Custom specs | Internal (Labnet), NAT (optional) |

## November 27th, 2025
### Goal
Initialize the homelab environment and configure the Windows Server 2012 domain controller.

### Windows Server 2012 Setup
The virtual machine was created with the following specifications:
- 30GB hard drive
- 4GB RAM
- 2 CPU cores

Two network adapters were configured:
- Internal network named Labnet for isolated communication
- NAT adapter to allow internet access for updates and downloads

### Timeline
**6:36 PM** — Powered on the server, no errors observed.

**7:15 PM** — Promoted the server to a Domain Controller as the first configuration step.

**7:22 PM** — Renamed the domain from DC1 to lab.net for clarity and future reference.

**7:25 PM** — Removed Active Directory Domain Services and reconfigured from scratch to apply the new domain name.

**7:25 PM** — Encountered a DNS delegation warning. This is expected because lab.net is a non-public, internal domain.

**7:28 PM** — Observed that the server was using a dynamic IP. Decided to assign a static IP to avoid network inconsistencies.

**7:46 PM** — Configured a static IPv4 address: 192.168.1.10.

**7:55 PM** — Performed ping tests; the server responded correctly, confirming successful network setup.

**7:56 PM** — Session ended for the day, lab setup is ready for continuation tomorrow.

Homelab Build & Documentation
Overview

This repository documents the full setup, configuration, and troubleshooting journey of building a virtualized homelab environment. The goal of this project is to practice real-world cybersecurity and systems administration tasks using Windows Server 2012, Windows 10, and Kali Linux inside a controlled virtual network. The lab includes:

    A Windows Server 2012 domain controller
    A Windows 10 workstation
    A Kali Linux attack box
    A fully isolated internal network ("Labnet") This documentation is written to demonstrate technical ability, problem-solving, and practical IT experience for employers and future projects.

Lab Architecture

Virtualization Platform: VirtualBox Internal Network Name: Labnet Purpose: Isolated test environment for Windows Server, Windows 10, and Kali Linux
Activity Log
Below is the day-by-day timeline of building the lab, including steps taken, problems encountered, and how they were resolved.

## December 4th, 2025
### Goal
Establish functional Group Policies for LAB.net to enforce realistic enterprise restrictions, generate reliable audit logs, support Snort traffic analysis, and enable controlled user‑simulation scenarios.


### Purpose
Implementing domain‑level policies ensures:
- Proper application of GPOs across users and computers
- Authentic domain login traffic suitable for Snort and Wireshark
- Realistic user behaviour simulation (browsing, activity logs, malware‑testing scenarios)
- Accurate segmentation for Kali‑based scanning and detection exercises


### Group Policy Configuration
**User Policies:**
• Restrict access to the Control Panel
• Apply domain password policy
• Limit access to PowerShell and Command Prompt


**Computer Policies:**
• Enable Windows Defender logging
• Enable Windows Firewall domain‑profile rules
• Turn on advanced auditing


### Timeline
8:55 AM — Opened DC1 and confirmed persistence of previous domain configurations, user additions and IP settings.


8:58 AM — Verified that all configurations remained intact and functioning correctly.


9:00 AM — Began creating Group Policies to simulate standard enterprise user restrictions.


9:00–9:14 AM — Configured restrictions for user accounts, including blocking Start Menu run options, Control Panel access and command‑line tools.


9:15 AM — Started creating a computer security baseline for the Windows 10 machine to ensure logs are generated for Snort and Wireshark analysis.


9:23 AM — Enabled Windows Firewall.


9:24–9:37 AM — Enabled and configured advanced auditing policies for:
• Account Management
• Logon/Logoff
• Account Logon
• Detailed Tracking
• Object Access
• Policy Changes
• Privilege Use
• System Events


9:39 AM — Forced a Group Policy update via Command Prompt.


9:42 AM — Booted the Windows 10 machine, verified IP persistence and applied **gpupdate /force** as administrator.


9:54 AM — Confirmed that Group Policy updates applied successfully on both the domain controller and the Windows 10 workstation.


9:55 AM — Used Event Viewer on the Windows 10 system to validate that advanced auditing settings were active. Logs were being generated correctly, confirming that forensic‑level auditing was now operational.

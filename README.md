# Project-Labtop
Project LABTOP (Home Lab on a Laptop) is a portable, fully virtualized cybersecurity home lab containing Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, Kali Linux, Snort, and vulnerability testing environments. Everything runs on a single laptop. The goal is to support continuous learning, practical experience, and employer-ready documentation.

Creating this home lab has been long overdue. As a recent graduate, my access to student resources has decreased, so maintaining my cybersecurity skills across both offensive and defensive disciplines now depends on building my own environment. This project documents the full journey of creating the lab, the issues I encounter along the way, and the troubleshooting techniques I apply. It also serves as a demonstration of my technical abilities, problem solving, adaptability, and commitment to lifelong learning. My learning journey does not stop here, and this project is my way of keeping the momentum going in a meaningful and structured way.
